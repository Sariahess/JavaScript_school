# bus_schedule_simple version 1.0

1. On the top-left of the view page, there's a search box (type-in-the-words)
[ * recommended search words : 'pembina', 'scurf' because a lot of other places don't have any bus stops ]
- type in certain letters/words and hit ENTER key to find names of places/roads in Winnipeg, MB, Canada
- empty search (as well as no words with SPACE only) won't show anything at the bottom of the search box
- as long as some letters of special characters (like ' or .) are together, the search box accepts and reads SPACE key 
- if there cannot be found any results regarding the search letters, 'No Results' shows up instead of lists of places

2. Click on the found lists to view if there are any bus-stops in the roads/places
- "Pembina Highway" or "Scurfield Boulevard" shows numerous results of bus-stops and info
- if there cannot be found any bus-stops, an error message "Error: There are no bus stops on this street" shows as pop-up (press OK to clear the message)
